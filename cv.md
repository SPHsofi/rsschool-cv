## About me

I just graduated from college, but already have a year of experience working in software and database development. Since childhood, I realized that I was inclined towards exact sciences. At school I loved mathematics and computer science. By the time I was in my senior year, I realized that I was attracted to programming and chose a direction for myself at the institute related to this.

I also actively play sports, go to volleyball and dance. Since childhood, I have been professionally involved in gymnastics, which has helped me succeed in such qualities as perseverance, the desire to finish what I started, communication skills, determination, stress resistance and many others.
